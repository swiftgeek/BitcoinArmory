Make sure you have MSVS 2005 or 2008.  [b]And if you are on a 64-bit system, make sure you select to install the x64 compilers under C++ options

(The MSVS 2010 project is desperately out of date.  Don't even bother trying it unless you're ready for a battle!  However, I will be updating at some point in the future, I just want to make available the 2005 project first.


Install Git and TortoiseGit
   http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.8-preview20111206.exe
   http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list


Clone the repo:
   Right click on the directory where you want the code to go: select "Git clone..."
   URL: git://github.com/etotheipi/BitcoinArmory.git
   Click OK


While that's going, start downloading python-related stuff (there's a lot!)

-- Download and install Python 2.6 or 2.7: 
         http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/
-- Download and install Python-Twisted:
         http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads
-- Download and install zope.interface (for python-twisted):
         http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/3.8.0#downloads
   Unless you know what to with an .egg file, you're going to have 
   to download the tar.gz, unpack it, and then execute setup.py via:
         python setup.py install
   
-- Download and UNPACK SWIG.  
         http://www.swig.org/download.html

   Move the inner-most swig-2.0.4 directory to BtcoinArmory/cppForSwig 
   (you should now see 3 subdirectories in cppForSwig dir:  
    cryptopp, reorgTest and swig-2.0.4):

-- Download and full-install PyQt4:
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

-- (OPTIONAL) py2exe AND pywin32 AND MSVCP90.dll
         http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/
         http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/

   MSVS is setup to create a standalone .exe of Armory if it finds
   py2exe (otherwise it bails at the last build-step, but you can 
   still manually run ArmoryQt.py as long as the SWIG dir is in the 
   right place, and all packages are installed).  pywin32 is needed
   to



During the last compilation step, you might observe an error about not finding 'python'.  For whatever reason, python doesn't add itself to your PATH environment variable.  You'll have to add ";C:\Python27\" or ";C:\Python26" to your path depending on which version you're using.  Do this through control panel, search for "environment" and then edit the path and append the appropriate string.  Reboot
